The Book Inventory System is a type of system that allows the user to store specific books including the information provided. The system helps both students and staff to keep a constant track of all the books available in the inventory. It is an automatic system that reduces the work burden of the staff/users through a single click. It will manage, organize, and orient the inventory task.

The project was done through C++ language where it includes the application of basic & advanced C++ input/output, control structures, output formatting, manipulating, and most of all file handling. More importantly, the intention of the project is to apply the practices and exercises of C++ students. Furthermore, the researchers encountered that most students and other users who  want to study C++ language do not have enough basis for applying certain areas to create a simple management system. Then, the researchers realized that both students and teachers need a simple concept of a system for learning and applying basic/advance C++ concepts. Therefore, this project serves as a guideline to the users who want to have a basis/concept in creating C++ management systems.  

The project serves as a basic guideline for students that need to learn C++ and other areas in C++ such as control structures, declaring variables, file handling, headers, comments, and formatting inputs. Then, the project was conducted for first-year programming students that currently take the C++ study field. The project was also conducted for learners and other people who are still currently new in C++. It can be served as both exercise and a lesson for students who want to apply their practices in C++.
